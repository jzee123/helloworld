README files typically include information on:

What the project does

Why the project is useful

How users can get started with the project

Where users can get help with your project

Who maintains and contributes to the project

If you put your README file in your repository's hidden .github, root, or docs directory, GitHub will recognize and automatically surface your README to repository visitors.
